# *mu* - system programming environment

### Under heavy development 

###### version 0.2.19

*mu* is a Lisp-idiomatic functionally-oriented interactive environment for system programming in the Rust ecosystem. It is targeted to low-resource persistent POSIX environments.

*mu* is a Lisp-1 namespaced programming language with Common Lisp idioms and macro system.

While *mu* has much in common with Scheme, it is meant to be familiar to traditional LISP programmers.

*mu* is a 2-LISP, which gives it flexibility in implementation and subsequent customization. A small native code runtime kernel supports system classes, function application, heap/system image management, garbage collection, and an FFI framework.

Subsequent layers based on the runtime offer advanced features.



#### Recent changes

------

- improved repl and development tool

- reorganized dist mechanism
  

#### Rationale

------

Functional languages bring us closer to a time when we can automatically prove our programs are correct. As systems get more complex, we'll need increased assurance that their various components are reliable. Modern programming concepts do much to underpin reliability and transparency.

*mu* attempts to express modern programming concepts with a simple, familiar syntax. The venerable Common Lisp macro system helps the system designer create domain specific languages.

*Lisps* are intentionally dynamic, which has selected against them for use in production environments. Statically-typed languages produce systems that are hard to interact with and impossible to change *in situ*. Few languages in use today have adequate meta-programming facilities. We need systems that can we reason about and can supplement themselves.

Current systems tend to be large and resource-hungry. We need lean systems that can do useful work in low resource environments and are flexible enough to evolve to meet new demands. Current systems have runtimes measured in days, if for no other reason than improving them requires a complete reinstall. A dynamic system can have a runtime measured in months or years.

Evolutionary response to change is the only defense a system has against obsolescence.

Most of our core computational frameworks are built on static systems and are fragile with respect to change. Such systems tend to be disposable. Lightweight dynamic systems designed for persistence are the next step.



#### Project Components and Goals

------



- *mu*, a small, configurable runtime library and language
- *mu-sys*, minimal POSIX command suitable for containers
- *qing*, a native code compiler
- *sys-dev* , a cargo-like development and packaging utility
- *sys-repl* , a configurable interactive tool for exzploration and debugging 
- small and simple installation
- add interactivity and extensibility to application implementations
- Rust FFI system
- mostly Common Lisp syntax
- Common Lisp macro system
- resource overhead equivalent to a UNIX shell
- futures for async and non-blocking I/O



#### State of the *system-lisp* system

------

*system-lisp* is a work in progress and under heavy development.

*system-lisp* runtime builds are targeted to:

- x86-64 and AArch-64 Linux distributions
- x86-64 WSL
- Docker Ubuntu and Alpine containers

Current binary releases on github are Linux x86-64, other architectures will follow.

Portability, libraries, deployment, documentation, and garbage collection are currently the top priorities.



#### About the *mu* kernel language

------

*mu* is an immutable, namespaced Lisp-1 that borrows heavily from *Scheme*, but is more closely related to the Common Lisp family of languages. *mu* syntax and constructs will be familiar to the traditional Lisp programmer. 

The *mu* runtime kernel is written in mostly-safe `rust` (the system image/heap facility *mmaps* a file and random user selected features may have unsafe implementations.)

The runtime implements 64 bit tagged pointers, is available as a crate, and extends a Rust API for embedded applications. The runtime is primarily a resource allocator and evaluator for the *mu* kernel language. *mu* provides the usual fixed-width numeric types, lists, fixed-arity lambdas, simple structs, LISP-1 symbol namespaces, streams, and specialized vectors in a garbage collected environment.

The *mu* 2-LISP system is organized as a stack of compilers, culminating in the *qing* native code compiler.

The *core* library provides *rest* lambdas, *closures*, expanded types, *macros*, and a reader/compiler for those forms.

Optional libraries provide a variety of enhancements and services, including Common LISP macros and binding special forms.




#### Viewing the documentation

------

*mu*, *utility*, and *core* reference cards can be found in ```doc/refcards``` in a variety of formats. They document the *mu*  and *core* namespaces, the runtime API, and options for running *mu-sys*, *sys-repl*, and *sys-dev*.

The *mu* crate rustdoc documentation can be generated by

```
% sys-dev doc
```

and will end up in ```doc/rustdoc```. The ``doc/rustdoc/mu``  subdirectory contains the starting ```index.html```.

The *mu* reference documentation is a collection of *markdown* files in `doc/reference`. To generate the documentation, you will need the *pandoc* utility, see *https://pandoc.org*

Once built, the *html* for the *reference* material is installed in *doc/reference/html*, starting with *index.html*.



#### About the Release

------

 The release is installed in `/opt/system-lisp`. 

```
/opt/system-lisp
├── bin
├── doc
│   └── html
├── lib
│   ├── core
│   ├── fasl
│   ├── format
│   └── image
├── modules
│   ├── common
│   │   ├── describe
│   │   └── metrics
│   ├── deftype
│   └── prelude
│       └── repl
└── system
```

To install a release from the github repository

```
cat system-lisp-x.y.z.tgz | (cd /opt ; sudo tar --no-same-owner -xzf -)
```

The `/opt/system-lisp` directory is hardwired into several tools and the release mechanism, changing it would require significant alteration of parts of the system. 

  

#### Building the *mu* system

------

```
version 0.2.10 is built with rustc 1.89.0
version 0.2.11 and 0.2.12 are built with rustc 1.90.0
version 0.2.13 and 0.2.14 are built with rustc 1.91.1
version 0.2.15 is built with rustc 1.93.0
version 0.2.16 is built with rustc 1.93.1
version 0.2.17 and 0.2.18 are built with rustc 1.94.0
version 0.2.19 is built with rustc 1.95.0
```

The *mu* runtime is a native code program that must be built for the target CPU architecture. The runtime build system requires only a `rust` development environment, `rust-fmt`, `clippy` and the  GNU `make` utility. The instructions below assume a developmentt system with `apt` package management.

Tests, performance, tools, and regression metrics require some version of `python 3` and `/usr/bin/time`.

```
sudo apt install time
git clone https://github.com/Software-Knife-and-Tool/system-lisp.git
```

After cloning the *system-lisp* repository, the system can be built and installed with the supplied makefile. The *world* target builds a release version of the system and the *sys-dev* development tool.  `make` with no arguments prints the available targets. 

```
% make world
```

Having built the distribution, install it in `/opt/system-lisp`.

```
% sudo make install
```

Having built and installed `system-lisp`,  establish the current directory as a `sys-dev`  workspace.

```
% sys-dev workspace init
```

Note: the *makefile* installation mechanism does not remove the installation directory before writing it and changes to directory structure and files will accumulate.



#### Features

------

The *mu* runtime supports conditional compilation of a variety of features. 

Currently supported features by namespace:

```
 default = [ "env", "core", "system" ]
 
 feature/core:			core process-mem-virt process-mem-res
 						process-time time-units-per-sec delay
 feature/env:			env heap-info heap-size heap-room cache-room namespace
 feature/system:		uname shell exit sysinfo
 feature/instrument:    instrument-control

```

The *sysinfo* feature is disabled on *macOS* builds.



#### Tools

------

The *system-lisp* distribution includes tools for configuring and development of the system..

The *sys-dev* command is found at `/opt/system-lisp/bin/sys-dev`.

```
Usage: sys-dev 0.0.20 command [option...]
  command:
    help                               ; this message
    version                            ; sys-dev version

    workspace init | env               ; manage workspace

    bench     base | current | report | clean [--ntests=number] [--all]
                                       ; benchmark test suite
    regression                         ; regression test suite
    symbols   reference | crossref | metrics [--namespace=name]
                                       ; symbol reports, namespace 
                                       ; defaults to mu
    precommit                          ; fmt and clippy, pre-commit checking

  general options:
    --verbose                          ; verbose operation
    --recipe                           ; show recipe
```

`sys-dev` is styled after `cargo` and fulfills many of the same functions. While the help message should be relatively explanatory, the general development workflow is something like this. Note that in this version **=** is mandatory for options with arguments.

Before making any changes, you should establish a performance baseline.

```
 sys-dev bench base [--ntests=50]
```

As you make changes, you can verify correctness and note any performance regressions.

Deviations of 20% or so in timing are normal, any changes in storage consumption or a persistent change in timing of an individual test significantly above 20% should be examined.

```
 cargo build --release --workspace      # build the release version 
 sys-dev regression                     # run the regression tests
 sys-dev bench current [--ntests=50]    # bench current build
 sys-dev bench report                   # print metric changes
```

The `symbols` command prints a list of the symbols in various namespaces and their types.

Profiling is nascent and will be expanded in future releases. 



#### REPL

------

The distribution includes a command line tool for running and interacting with the system. The *sys-repl* binary is part of the release, found at `/opt/system-lisp/bin/sys-repl`.

*sys-repl* has no command line arguments. It is configured by an optional JSON file, *.sys-replrc*, which is expected to be in either the current directory or the user's home directory. The *config* argument supplies a *mu* environment configuration string (see **System Configuration** for details), and the *load* argument supplies a list of the names of files to load on startup using the *loader* function. The *reader* argument, currently limited to `core` or `mu` (the default) tells *sys-repl* to run in the indicated namespace and use the associated reader. *require* is a list of modules to be loaded by core:require, and *lib* is a list of *.sys* modules to be loaded from the release *lib* directory. *options* contains a list of *sys-repl* options (of which there are none as of 0.0.5). All arguments are optional.  

```
{
    "options": [ ],
    "config": {
        "pages": "2048",
        "gc-mode": "auto"
    },
    "lib": [ "core.sys" ],
    "reader": "core",
    "require": [ ],
    "loader": "core:load",
    "load": [ ]
}
```

*rlwrap* makes the *repl* listener much more useful, with command history and line editing.

```
% alias ,repl='rlwrap repl'
```

Depending on your version of *rlwrap*, *,repl* may exhibit odd echoing behavior. Adding

```
set enable-bracketed-paste off
```

to your `~/.inputrc` may help.



#### Regression Testing

------

The distribution includes a test suite, which should be run after every interesting change. The test suite consists of a several hundred individual tests roughly separated by namespace.

Failures in the *mu* tests are almost guaranteed to cause complete failure of subsequent tests.

```
% sys-dev regression
```



#### Performance metrics

------

Metrics include the average amount of time (in microsconds) taken for an individual test and the number of objects allocated by that test. Differences between runs in the same installation can be in the 20% range. Any changes in storage consumption or a large (20% or greater) increase in test timing warrant examination. Note: `ntests` of 50 seem to demonstrate least variation between runs of identical *mu* binaries.

```
% sys-dev bench base [--ntests=50]
% sys-dev bench current [--ntests=50]
% sys-dev bench report
```

On a modern Core I7 CPU at 3+ GHz, the default performance tests take around 10 minutes of elapsed time. 

The `base` target produces a performance run and establishes a baseline. The `current`  target produces a secondary performance run. The `report` target produces a human-readable diff between `base` and `current`.  Normally, you'd run a baseline, make some changes, and then do a current run to see if there were any regressions.

In specific, `report` produces a summary of significant performance changes (differences in measured resource consumption and/or a large difference in average test time between the current summary and the baseline summary.)



#### System release and utilities

------

The *mu* binaries and libraries are installed in `/opt/system-lisp`. The `bin` directory contains the binaries for running the system. The command line options for these utilities are documented in `doc/refcards/utilities.[docx,pdf]`

```
/opt/system-lisp/bin
├── sys-dev		# development tool
├── sys-repl		# runtime binary, stdio repl
├── mu-exec		# image executor
├── mu-server	# runtime binary, socket repl
└── mu-sys		# runtime binary
```

`mu-sys` is the base runtime utility.


```
